Xmas Mod 2025
</h1>

Welcome, to the second Xmas Mod

This time, we have more polished and bugfree features (you heard that right, mattcy made a bugfree mod with lerp).
It’s based on last year’s mod, but instead of The Grinch, we have Krampus a similar boss with his own unique traits.
It still has a story, custom Xmas themed bloons, 2 full 5-5-5 towers, a Gift Shop, gift currency, and a bunch more content.

# Get ready to save Xmas once again!
