Christmas Mod 2025
</h1>

Welcome, to the second Xmas Mod

It’s based on last year’s mod, but instead of The Grinch, the antagonist is Krampus; a similar boss, but with his own
unique traits. It includes custom dialogue to help bring the story to life, custom Xmas themed bloons, 2 full 5-5-5
towers, a gift shop, and much more!

Get ready to save Xmas once again!
